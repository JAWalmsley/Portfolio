NEATJS is a Javascript implementation of the paper [Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. It is a genetic algorithm for evolving neural networks in a way that simulates the real process of evolution. Connections and nodes in the neural network are encoded as genomes and are cross-bred with other neural networks to produce the next population. I have applied the algorithm to Pong and Flappy Bird as a demonstration, but it could be applied to many problems.
